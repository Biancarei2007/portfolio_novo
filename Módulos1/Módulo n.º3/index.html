    <h2>Getting Started with Compute</h2>
    <h4>When you consider running your workloads on Amazon Web Services (AWS), you will want to consider your compute options.AWS provides the services that you need to build the compute solution thats right for your workload and your business.</h4>
    <h4>You will review the primary compute types and the differences between them.You will also learn how computing balances different amounts of compute, memory, storage, and networking to optimize for your use case.</h4>
<h3>Course level</h3>
<h4>This foundational level course is written for learners who are beginning with cloud computing and AWS services. When you start this course, you dont need to have a deep knowledge of cloud computing. If you have more knowledge of cloud computing, you might still find this course helpful in refreshing your knowledge and practicing your skills.It would be helpful for your learning if you have a basic understanding of cloud computing concepts and the AWS Management Console. AWS Educate supports this background with courses, which include the following:</h4>
<h4><li>AWS Educate Introduction to the AWS Management Console</li></h4>
<h4><li>AWS Educate Introduction to Cloud 101</li></h4>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<h4>By the end of this course, you will be able to do the following:</h4>
<h4><li>Discuss different types of compute solutions and their features and benefits.</li></h4>
<h4><li>Discuss the basic features and concepts of Amazon EC2.</li></h4>
<h4><li>Describe EC2 instance types and how to choose an instance type.</li></h4>
<h4><li>Describe how to use Amazon EC2 to launch and configure an instance.</li></h4>
<h4><li>Describe how to manage EC2 instances.</li></h4>
<h4><li>Use Amazon EC2 to launch and manage and instance.</li></h4>

<h2>Getting Started with Storage</h2>
<h4>When you consider running your workloads on Amazon Web Services (AWS), you might first consider your storage options. AWS storage provides the services that you need to build the storage solution thats right for your business. You will review the primary storage types and the differences between them. You will also learn how to identify the right solution in the cloud based on your requirements. </h4>
<h4>You will then focus on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.  Customers of all sizes and industries can use Amazon S3 to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases. These use cases include websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and big data analytics. </h4>
<h4>In this course, you acquire the knowledge that you need to start using Amazon S3. You learn about the key elements of Amazon S3 and explore how to configure them. You learn how to upload data to Amazon S3 and what additional AWS services you can use to transfer data to Amazon S3 at scale. You also learn the basic elements of security within Amazon S3. </h4>

<h4><li>Discuss the features and concepts of Amazon S3.</li></h4>
<h4><li>Describe Amazon S3 storage classes and associated use cases.</li></h4>
<h4><li>Discuss how to use Amazon S3 to create a bucket, upload objects, and work with objects.</li></h4>
<h4><li>Describe Amazon S3 configurations for cost savings and security.</li></h4>
<h4><li>Identify other AWS storage solutions and their use cases.</li></h4>
<h4><li>Use Amazon S3 to create a static website.</li></h4>

<h2>Getting Started with Networking</h2>
<h4>Computer networking refers to interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources with each other. These networked devices use a system of rules, called communications protocols, to transmit information over physical or wireless technologies. Modern-day network solutions deliver more than connectivity. They are critical for the digital transformation and success of businesses today.</h4>
<h4>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) is a service that you can use to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud. This section (called a virtual private cloud, or VPC) is where you can launch your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources. With Amazon VPC, you have control over your virtual networking resources. These resources include the selection of your own IP address range, the creation of subnets, and the configuration of route tables and network gateways.</h4>
<h4>In this course, you acquire the knowledge you that you need to start using Amazon VPC. You learn about the key elements of Amazon VPC and explore how to configure them. You learn how to set up security for VPCs and learn about other AWS networking services.</h4>

<h4><li>Describe networking fundamental concepts.</li></h4>
<h4><li>Explain Amazon VPC features, benefits, and use cases.</li></h4>
<h4><li>Discuss how to configure public and private subnets.</li></h4>
<h4><li>Discuss how to configure route tables to direct traffic in your network.</li></h4>
<h4><li>Describe how to use an internet gateway and a virtual private gateway to allow traffic into your network.</li></h4>
<h4><li>Discuss how to configure security in a VPC by using network access control lists (network ACLs) and security groups.</li></h4>
<h4><li>Describe types of IP addressing, including use and benefits.</li></h4>
<h4><li>Dentify ways to manage your VPC.</li></h4>
